# 11-1. City, Country:
# Write a function that accepts two parameters: a city name
# and a country name. The function should return a single string of the form
# City, Country, such as Santiago, Chile. Store the function in a module called
# city_functions.py.
# Create a file called test_cities.py that tests the function you just wrote
# (remember that you need to import unittest and the function you want to test).
# Write a method called test_city_country() to verify that calling your function
# with values such as 'santiago' and 'chile' results in the correct string. Run
# test_cities.py, and make sure test_city_country() passes.

# 11-2. Population:
# Modify your function so it requires a third parameter,
# population. It should now return a single string of the form City, Country –
# population xxx, such as Santiago, Chile – population 5000000. Run
# test_cities.py again. Make sure test_city_country() fails this time.
# Modify the function so the population parameter is optional. Run
# test_cities.py again, and make sure test_city_country() passes again.
# Write a second test called test_city_country_population() that verifies you
# can call your function with the values 'santiago', 'chile', and
# 'population=5000000'. Run test_cities.py again, and make sure this new test
# passes
